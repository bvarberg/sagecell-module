===============

A repository for the Drupal (7.x) module - 'Sage Cell field'

Module's purpose
================

Adds 'Sage Cell field' to the user's available form fields. The Sage Cell field will create a Sage Cell field
widget (edit form) and a Sage Cell field output (formatted view when rendered on a normal page: viewed by a user).

The field widget allows the user to evaluate their Sage code and debug on the submission form.
The final field (in a block) is displayed as an evaluatable Sage Cell with the user's code as the value in the cell.
